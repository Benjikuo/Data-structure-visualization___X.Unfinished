## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- This is the group project for the Data Structure course. We choose this topic because it is the most relevant.
- It is also a good opportunity to learn JS and practice using those data structures in algorithms.
- I think after I finish this project, I will learn a lot. It will benefit me in future web projects.

## 💡 Tips for Magicians
- Use the card spread to let the spectator pick a random card.
- Keep the cards visible on screen to help magician remember the spectator’s card or your prediction.
- Through the stack system, the magician can identify the spectator’s card or determine its position in the deck.
- Using a secret card-swap method, the magician ensures the spectator always chooses the target card.
- Make the card in the stack face the same direction secretly using the assigned hotkey.
